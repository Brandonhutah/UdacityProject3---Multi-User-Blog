Project 3 - Multi User Blog

What is it?
-------------
A combination of back-end mixed with front-end through the use of templates. This blog allows users to create and signin to accounts. They can post, edit, and delete blog posts created by them. They can also comment on blog posts,
as well as edit and delete their own comments. Users can also like other peoples blog posts.

To Run
-------------
This app is deployed to Google's cloud service at https://udacity-work-153920.appspot.com/

Alternatively if you cd into the same directory that this readme file is in and run dev_appserver.py . (part of Google Shell SDK) you can run this website locally and navigate to it by going to localhost:8080 in a browser.
